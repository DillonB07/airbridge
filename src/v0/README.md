# Get all badges, sorted by the number of people who have earned them
curl https://api2.hackclub.com/v0/Operations/Badges?select={"sort":[{"field":"People Count","direction":"desc"}]}

# You can combine arguments too. Here we'll sort badges by the number of people
# and select the single record at the top of the list to get the badge with the
# most users
